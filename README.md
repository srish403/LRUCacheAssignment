# LRU Cache Implementation in C++

## overview
This repository contains a C++ implementation of an LRU (Least Recently Used) Cache.The cache supports get and put operations with O(1) average time complexity using a combination of a doubly linked list and a hash map.

## Features
- Insert key-value pairs (put operation)
- Retrieve values by key (get operation)
- Automatically removes the least recently used item when capacity is reached

## Usage
- Compile the code using any C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later.
- The main() function contains sample operations demonstrating usage.
  
 ## Constraints
- Capacity of cache is defined at initialization.
- Keys and values are integers.
- Operations perform in average O(1) time.
